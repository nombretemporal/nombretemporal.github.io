## About

I am **Daniel Tiskin**, a halfbred linguist-philosopher currently [affiliated](https://www.hse.ru/org/persons/109848504) with Higher School of Economics—St Petersburg and (part-time) the Institute for Linguistic Studies RAS, previously also with [St Petersburg University](https://spbu.ru/). I have taught logic (and more applied related disciplines), basic formal syntax & semantics, and philosophy (of language and otherwise).

One more thing I am doing is school olympiads, primarily in the Russian language; see also my [amateur data science essays](https://github.com/nombretemporal/school-olympiads) on that topic.

## Output

[Here](teaching/linguistics.md) are some of the more contentful teaching materials that I produced. Otherwise, come back later for updates if I am laborious enough to post them.

## Contact
I am available by e-mail, `daniel.tiskin@gmail.com` or—if urgent—via [Telegram](https://t.me/tiskin).

Much of my earlier work is available at [Academia.edu](https://spbu.academia.edu/tiskin), and some teaching materials are at [my older personal page](https://sites.google.com/view/tiskin).
