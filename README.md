## About
I am **Daniel Tiskin**, a halfbred linguist-philosopher with a track of affiliations primarily with [St Petersburg University](https://spbu.ru/) & [HSE St Petersburg](https://spb.hse.ru/). I have taught logic, basic formal syntax & semantics, and philosophy.

When pressed to do research, I usually study the Russian language in its syntactic and semantic aspects or explore the philosophical and semantic dimension of propositional attitude reports. As of 2022, I am part of [one on-going team project](https://rscf.ru/project/22-18-00591/).

One more thing I am doing is school olympiads; see also my [amateur data science essays](https://github.com/nombretemporal/school-olympiads) on that topic.
