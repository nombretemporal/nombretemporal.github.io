## About

I am **Daniel Tiskin**, a linguist-philosopher currently at the [Higher School of Economics—St Petersburg](https://www.hse.ru/org/persons/109848504) and (part-time) at the Institute for Linguistic Studies RAS, previously also with [St Petersburg University](https://spbu.ru/). I have taught logic (and more applied related disciplines), basic formal syntax & semantics, and philosophy (of language and otherwise).

One more thing I am doing is school olympiads, primarily in the Russian language.

You can contact me at `daniel.tiskin@gmail.com`.

## Teaching

[Here](teaching/linguistics.md) are some of the more valuable teaching materials that I produced (in Russian). There are some more at [my very old personal page](https://sites.google.com/view/tiskin).

## Research

Semantics and a bit of syntax and philosophy. The list with some presentations and publications is [here](research/linguistics.md).
